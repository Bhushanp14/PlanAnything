### 🎨 UI Design Notes
- Keep consistent padding and rounded corners (modern app feel)
- Header with logo “PlanAnything” and navigation (Dashboard | Profile | Logout)
- Use a clean font (e.g., Inter or Poppins)
- Calendar cells should highlight today’s date and display tasks as colored dots
- Add a Click on any date to Add Task helper text on View Plan details page.
